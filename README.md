# CPSC 310: Introduction to TypeScript

This repo contains the starter files for the [video tutorial on TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMIZ9Oto-6s)
offered by CPSC 310: Introduction to Software Engineering, at UBC. We'll be using JavaScript in our programming exercises
to warm up, but the things you learn will be applicable to the TypeScript development you'll be doing throughout the course.

## Requirements
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)
  * we'll be running the TypeScript compiler `tsc` via the command line

## Running files

You can run JavaScript (`.js`) files directly via node on the command line. Running the following

```sh
> node hello.js
```

Should print out "Hello, world!" to the console.
